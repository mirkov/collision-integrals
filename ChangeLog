	* lj-collision-integral-table-interpolations.lisp
	(with-verbose-table-interpolation): 
	(omega*%-11, omega*%-12, omega*%-13, omega*%-14, omega*%-15)
	(omega*%-22): Added error handling when t*
	is outside of Ivchenko's table domain
	(with-verbose-table-interpolation): Envornment for handling out-of
	range T*

	* collision-integrals.asd (:collision-integrals): module loading
	dependency on module "package"

2012-05-13  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* collision-integrals-user.lisp (demo): Fixed spelling error

	* omega-star-combinations.lisp: Added omega-* combination
	functions A*, B*, C*, E* and F*

2012-04-25  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* collision-parameters.lisp (hard-sphere-collision-parameters):
	Bug in class inheritance.  I had incorrectly specified
	lennar-jones-6/12 instead of hard-sphere


2011-10-16  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* collision-parameters.lisp (make-collision-parameters): Fixed bug
	in calculating sigma for same-species collisions.  It was twice as
	large as it should have been

	* omega-hs.lisp (omega-11-hs%): Modified numerical constants to
	agree with (Ferziger & Kaper, 9.2-4)

2011-09-15  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* omega-hs.lisp (omega-11-hs%): Changed argument units from SI to
	amu angstrom

2011-09-13  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* collision-parameters.lisp (collision-parameters): Changed object
	layout of collision parameters.  Work still in progress

	* omega-gf+defaults.lisp (defomega-ij): Changed omega-ij-hs calls
	to the ew object based omega-ij-hs calling convention

	* omega-hs.lisp Complete rewrite of the file.  The omega-xy-hs are
	now generic functions with one method that specializes on the
	objects of the hard-sphere-potential class.  With two helper
	fuctions, a macro is used to ease the definition of the generic
	functions and their methods.

	* collision-parameters.lisp
	(make-lennard-jones-6/12-collision-parameters): Changed code to
	use the potential objects from `molecular-potentials' to retreive
	potential parameters

	* collision-integrals.asd (:collision-integrals): Added file
	`collision-parameters' to the system

2011-09-10  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* omega-gf+defaults.lisp (:omega-xx): Changing collision integrals
	to depend not on molecular potentials, but on collision
	parameters, which can be different from the molecular potentials.
	This will require a revamp of part of the system, and also a
	change to molecular-potentials system.

	* doc/collision-integrals-cl-package.org: Fixing argument order:
	mass, temperature, rest in documentation and code.

	* omega-hs.lisp: Fixed multiple bugs introduced by the change in
	parameter oredring from temperature mass sigma to mass temperature
	sigma.  The bug was detected by unit test failures

2011-09-06  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* lj-collision-integral-fits.lisp (omega*%-11, omega*%-22): Fixed
	typos in arguments due to change in naming convenction

	* omega-gf+defaults.lisp (defomega-ij): Verified definition of
	`omega-ij' as `omega*-ij * omega-ij-hs'

	* lj-default-methods.lisp (default-omega*-lj-calc-method)
	(set-default-omega*-lj-calc-method): Changed argument name from
	`reduced-collision-integral' to omega*.  Improved error handling
	with assert.  The code offers the user to input a different
	omega*.

2011-09-05  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* collision-integrals.asd (:collision-integrals): Factored out
	package setup into own module

2011-09-04  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* setup-default-methods.lisp (default-omega-calc-method)
	(set-default-omega-calc-method): Renamed arguments to be more
	descriptive

	* collision-integrals.asd (:collision-integrals-user): Added
	collision-integrals-user definition.  Commented out
	hard-sphere-coeffs as I will use only the diameter to signal a
	hard-sphere collision model.

2011-08-31  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* general-collision-integrals.lisp: Removed the `export' statement
	moving all the exports into the package definition.  Modified
	general collision integrals from functions into generic functions,
	modified calling definitions and added documentations to generic
	functions

	* lj-collision-integral-table-interpolations.lisp: Removed the
	`export' statement moving all the exports into the package
	definition.  Renamed the methods according to current naming
	convention.  Changed argument specializers to new convention.

	* lj-collision-integral-fits.lisp: Removed the `export' statement
	moving all the exports into the package definition.  Major
	reorganization of the class structure and provided functionality.
	We now generate and export special variables that encapsulate the
	fits, and trigger the execution of appropriate methods.

	* hard-sphere-coeffs.lisp: Removed the `export' statement moving
	all the exports into the package definition.

	* hs-collision-integrals.lisp: Removed the `export' statement
	moving all the exports into the package definition.  Fixed the
	function names to the new naming convention.

	* setup-explicit-and-default-functions.lisp: Removed the `export'
	statement moving all the exports into the package definition.
	Renamed the reduced integral methods with specified model from %
	into *%.  Other edits to conform with new naming conventions.

	* collision-integrals-package-def.lisp (:collision-integrals):
	Moved all exported variables into this file and added documenting
	comments

	* lj-collision-integral-table-interpolations.lisp
	(*data-directory*): Set value to asdf system directory

	* collision-integrals.asd (:collision-integrals): Removed
	lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp into their own package,
	molecular-potentials

2011-08-30  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* hs-collision-integrals.lisp (omega-11%, omega-12%, omega-13%)
	(omega-14%, omega-15%, omega-22%): Changed the qualifier from
	:hs-11, :hs-12, ... etc into :hs.  Also changed return value to
	1.0 since omega-LS% return the reduced integrals


	* general-collision-integrals.lisp: New file with functions
	`omega-xx', and exporting all the functions

	* collision-integrals.asd (:collision-integrals): Added dependency
	on `general-collision-integrals.lisp'

	* collision-integrals/assign-collision-integral-default-methods.lisp (tabulated-omega*):
	Made changes to conform to renaming of entries in *omega-calc-defaults*

	* collision-integrals/setup-default-methods.lisp
	(*omega-calc-defaults*): Renamed alist entries to omega*-xy

	* collision-integrals/lj-collision-integral-table-interpolations.lisp
	(*omega*-table*): Added special variable to hold the interpolation
	table.  This makes it easier to specify table interpolation as a
	calculation method
	(*omega*-table*): Added variable to list of exported symbols
