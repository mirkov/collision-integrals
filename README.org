Collision integrals

Package for calculating intermolecular collision integrals used in
transport coefficient calculations of low pressure gases.

Package offers
- Collision integrals for hard-sphere collisions
- Reduced collision integrals for the 6-12 Lennard-Jones potential.
  Multiple methods are offered:
  - Analytic expressions for Omega-11* and Omega22*
  - Interpolation of tables by Ivchenko et al
- Mechanism for choosing the default calculation method or to use a
  specific calculation method.
- Certain combinations of the reduced \Omega integrals, A^*, B^*, C^*, E^*, and
  F^*
